GIM Runtime Configuration

The GIM configuration file /etc/gim_config can be created after first time load
gim.ko. It can configure runtime GIM behaviors.

There are 7 options: vf_num, pf_fb, vf_fb, fb_option, sched_interval,
sched_option, fb_clear.

1. vf_num
 The "vf_num" specifies the number of virtual functions to be enabled. It can
 be set to any number between 0 and 16.

 vf_num = 0
 It enables maximum available virtual functions that the specific in
 vendor defined CAP register SRIOV_NUM_VFS in pci config space.

 vf_num=[1…16]
 enables the specified number of VFs on the bus when GIM is loaded. If the
 value is set to larger than the GPU/VBios combination can support it will
 be reduced to the number defined in register SRIOV_NUM_VFS.

2. pf_fb
 The “pf_fb” parameter specifies the amount of Frame Buffer memory reserved
 for the PF.  The Frame Buffer size is in units of 1 MB but should be specified
 in multiples of 16MB.  If the size is not specified in a multiple of 16MB, the
 size will be rounded down to the nearest 16MB boundary. Valid values are
 between 0 and 65536. A value of 65536 represents 64G which is far beyond the
 8GB FB size of the S7150. Setting bigger PF frame buffer leads to less VF
 frame buffer left.

 Min_PF_FB_Size is same as BAR0 size. But if "large bar0" feature is
 enabled, Min_PF_FB_Size will be fixed to 16M.

 Max_PF_FB_Size = total FB - (Min_VF_FB_Size * vf_num) - CSA - Alignment.
 total FB is get from register TOTAL_FB_AVAILABLE in PCI header.
 Min_VF_FB_Size is VF FB BAR0 aperture size. CSA means context save/restore
 area.

 If a value is specified above the Max_PF_FB_Size, then the real PF FB size
 will be Max_PF_FB_Size.

 If a value is specified below the Min_PF_FB_Size, then the real PF FB size
 will be Min_PF_FB_Size.

 pf_fb=[0…Min_PF_FB_Size]
 PF FB size is Min_PF_FB_Size.

 pf_fb=[Min_PF_FB_Size…Max_PF_FB_Size]
 Size of PF FB reservation in MB units. The PF FB should be in multiple of 16M
 unit. If set to a value which is not in multiple of 16M, the size will be
 rounded down to nearest 16M boundary.

 pf_fb=[16…8176]
 PF FB size is Max_PF_FB_Size.

3. vf_fb
 The “vf_fb” specifies the amount of VF FB size in the unit of MB. The valid
 values are between 0 and 65536. vf_fb should be set to a multiple of 16M, any
 value which is not in a multiple of 16M will be rounded down to the nearest
 16M boundary. A value of 65536 means 64G which is far beyond the actual FB
 size 8G on S7150.i VF FB is assigned after PF FB.

 Min_VF_FB_Size = VF FB BAR0 aperture size.

 Max_VF_FB_Size = (total FB - PF FB - reservation)/vf_num, and round down to
 multiple of 16M.

 vf_fb = 0
 Divide the available FrameBuffer equally amongst the VFs. Each VF FB size is
 Max_VF_FB_Size.

 vf_fb[1..65536]
 Currently, the S7150 has set each VF to have 256M FB aperture in the SRIOV
 BAR. The VF FB size cannot be smaller than the VF aperture and will be
 adjusted accordingly. Under some circumstances where SBIOS has difficulties
 allocating resources for SRIOV a special VBIOS is required that will specify
 a smaller BAR size as 128MB for each VF.

 if vf_fb < Min_VF_FB_Size, the final real frame buffer is Min_VF_FB_Size.
 if vf_fb > Max_VF_FB_Size, the final real frame buffer is Max_VF_FB_Size.
 otherwise, the final real frame buffer is same as vf_fb.

 This option is valid only when fb_option=0.

4. fb_option
 The "fb_option" specifies the VF frame buffer partitioning method. It only
 supports two values:

 fb_option = 0
 Divide the Frame Buffer equally amongst all of the available VFs.  This is
 the default value.  The size of the VF FB size can be modified by the vf_fb
 option.

 fb_option = 1
 Each VF can have a different FB size. It is not supported yet.

5. sched_interval
 Scheduling time quanta in milliseconds. Thed valid value are between 0 and
 2000.

 sched_interval = 0
 default quanta(6ms)

 sched_interval = [1:2000]
 Real number of quanta in miliseconds.

6. sched_option
 The "sched_option" specifies the algorithm that will be used to determine how
 the GPU time is divided between the active VFs. It only supports two values:

 sched_option = 0
 Active VFs will get a time slice in a "round robin" style. The size of the time
 slice is determined by the "sched_interval" option.

 sched_option = 1
 All VFs will share HW resoruce equally by almost same time slice in turns. Even
 the VF is stop, the VF still can occupy the HW resource.

7. fb_clear
 Clear the VRAM for VF

 fb_clear = 0
 Default value.Skip to clear framebuffer

 fb_clear = 1
 Clear FB of VF when VF is free or down
